# 2D MitoNet (empanada)


*MitoNet*: A generalist mitochondrial instance segmentation model trained using empanada


[empanada](https://github.com/volume-em/empanada) is a tool for deep learning-based panoptic segmentation of 2D and 3D electron microscopy images of cells.
This plugin allows the running of panoptic segmentation models trained in empanada within [napari](https://napari.org).

**Documentation for empanada, including more detailed installation instructions, can be found [here](https://empanada.readthedocs.io/en/latest/empanada-napari.html).**


## Example Datasets

Volume EM datasets for benchmarking mitochondrial instance segmentation are available from
[EMPIAR-10982](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/empiar/EMPIAR-10982/).
